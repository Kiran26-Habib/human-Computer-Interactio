## Design Alternative ##

1. ### 1 Design Alternative ###
- Our first design alternative was focused on a different layout of the website then what we currently had. We wanted to see how this would affect the overall presentation and make sure that we were starting with a good basic principle.
  
  ### 2 Design Alternative ###
- This version has the same basic layout as our original site, but weâ€™ve stripped it down to the important features and kept a minimalist design.
  
  ### 2 Design Alternative ###
- Our third iteration of the design, and probably best if only because it uses lessons from the first two, this design continues to use the same original layout but with some better visual elements.
